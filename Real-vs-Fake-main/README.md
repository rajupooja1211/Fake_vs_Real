# Real-vs-Fake
The categorization of news related to COVID- 19 into distinct classifications of ”real” and ”fake” represents a pivotal undertaking in our quest to discern the authenticity of information circulating in the midst of the pandemic. This project involves the meticulous examination and evaluation of news articles, social media posts, and various online sources to ascertain their credibility. By distinguish- ing between genuine and misleading information, we aim to foster a more informed public discourse and combat the spread of misinformation.
We do this using machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GDBT), we have classified the news into real and fake.

Usage in Google Colab

Open the Colab Notebook:
Open the provided Colab notebook (ML SVM LR.ipynb and Stats.ipynb) in Google Colab.

Run the Cells:
First execute the cells in Stats.ipynb then ML SVM LR.ipynb.
Execute the cells in the notebook one by one to run the script step by step.

Output:
Stats file generates Word cloud of the words most frequently used Real and Fake news articles. We also count the occurance of words for our analysis.

Data Source:
A collection of news articles from Twitter, Whatsapp and other legitimate sources like News paper articles.

Configuration
You can customize the script behavior by modifying configuration parameters in the notebook.
